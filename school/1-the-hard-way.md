# Step 1
## The Hard Way

First of all, leave all the cool stuff out: there is no better way to learn how the web real works than doing it from skretches.

Yes, we know: it's frustrating, boring and not useful at all, but it's the way each developer started with. Do not spend too much time on it, but do it.

## Requirements

- a LAMP stack
- PHP
- MySQL/MariaDB

## What to do

We suggest you to make something simple (eg a blog) that has at least these features:

- Basic Authentication
- At least 3 sql tables
- At least 3 pages
- A nice design
- One db operation done in frontend (with no refresh)
