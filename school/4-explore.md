# Step 4

## Now REST

Yes, now you think you have the world in your hands. But you're way far to reach
the end. You won't. There are a lot of other things and everyday new things come out.

What we think you can start from is NodeJS. Start another project and use this
awesome language instead of the language you used so far. You will experience
having tons of npm packages and a so many nice things.

Then you might prefer going back to what you used before, but you should really
know it.

Explore also other tools on the client side: probably while this file is being
written another tool has been developed. You can try WebComponents, WebSockets,
RxJS...

Soon you will realize that this step doesn't have an end. Have fun!
