# Step 2

## Backend framework

Now that you've lost your head during step 1, let's add a new step: let's use a backend framework!
Thank to your prevous exercise (you did it, right?!) you'll be able all to love all this new stuff.

You can either stay with PHP or choose another language. Here we list all the languages we suggest you to study,
with related frameworks. 

- PHP
  - Laravel
  - Symphony
- Python
  - Django
- Ruby
  - Ruby on Rails

Note: these are jsut the ones we are experienced with, there are a lot more! Some of them are easier than the others but all of those are great technologies.
Have a look to the official documentations and choose the one that you think is nicer.

Include also a css framework like Bootstrap or Foundation and do no write any other css! If you don't like the design, you can still implement a theme.
In this way you'll get to know how css frameworks work and you won't ever have to write any annoying and useless css.

Remember: by now, never reinvent the wheel! Only use what already exists.

## How to get started

Each framework has a *get started* guide. Don't be lazy and read it!

## What to do

You can do the same thing of step 1, or you can change project: let your imagination choose.
You'll see that, once you've learned the framework, doing that will be way easier.
It's always gonna be like that: no more boring code, learn cool things, have fun!
