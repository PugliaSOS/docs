# Step 3

## Now REST

It was fun, right?

Lets go still ahead: another idea, another project but same framework. What's
the difference? There will be no html rendering on the server side. Instead
you will only create a RESTful server, while all the other stuff will be done
by another framework, a frontend one. You can choose:

- AngularJS (1.x)
- ReactJS
- EmberJS

Once again, we think these ones are great framework but there are a lot of other
things out there: if you know one and you like it more, use it.
