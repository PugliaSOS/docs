## Static

Even before starting writing *real* code, you need to know how to create a static website.
We know that right now you'll be probably thinking "static website are for noobs, I'm not
gonna do that". Wrong. There are a lot of scenarios where a static website is way more
efficient than anything else. In fact it is also fun.

To start, pick a static website generator (we strongly suggest [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
but you can choose another one from [here](https://www.staticgen.com/)) and build your own
website.

## Requirements

- homepage with personal informations
- blog section with some blogposts
- it must look nice

## What to do

- read the framework documentation
- read [how to host a static website on GitHub](https://pages.github.com/)
- make it
